- the preceding copyBlock works, but not quite as suggested
  - this is quite unlikely to support imbedded links, since it is intended to be a documentation tool
- 2 files still have examples that WORK and a mid (not top ) placement was also found to be working, but may have been damaged

    - will links work in these blocks
      - can HTML anchors be used?
  - these Comments should be a part of my quickLinks area(s)
    - confirm headings cannot be added, like this:
      - [CivicAtlas](https://github.com/Data-Integrity-Group/Wip#civicatlas)

  - "quick" CurbSide explanations are opaque to nonTwFolk
    - especially to those who are looking for quickStarts.
      - who need a more immediate focus to avoid learningCurve frustration(s)

## 2023 quickLinks
- [2023's anticipated challenges](https://github.com/HwWobbe/WipHww/blob/main/6.0%20Conclusions.md#challenges)
  - EdD summary creation will be more demanding as supporting material
    - a second project may be helpful, but doubles the documentation
    - the amalgamation triggered CRA notification(s)
      - discuss the implications of this - in spite of the apparent lack of concern in LsH chats
 
- https://github.com/HwWobbe/WipHww/blob/main/README.md#-2023-07
  - Preparing documentation supporting La(titude) Lo(ngitude) Al(titude) for each of many specific Audiences
    - MailFail ; Tripartite ( Cities upwards > Provinces > federal Institutions )
      - Open Source to start < "free-mium" to scale )
        - Teranet ...
    - this should integrate the priliminary StringServer work
      - link to the PostalCodesCa introduction - which shiould link to the wikiPedia page
    - further integration to myId should also happen
      - consider the E0n app as an entry point
      

- Business Continuity requires Ownership Transition
  - see Wp:Entity ( WikiPedia )
    - this is fundamentally important since:
      - growth requires:
        - improved Services and Products
        - retention of expertise
        - access to capital
  - do not inundate Antendees with the legal aspects of Goverance
    - strive to avoid even using the Governance term, since it is not of general interest byond shareholders and their representatives

- use when Files are displayed -- https://github.com/HwWobbe/WipHww/blob/main/README.md#-2023-08
  - https://github.com/HwWobbe/DefinitiveData-DeltaAlerts

- hypothesis & Diigo - could be copied to XmmxH
  - does either of these accept email(ed) posts?
    - "...talk..." (as implemented at TW does)
    - Evernote does
    - review RSS or its new versions (perticularly on Mobile devices)
  - Create a PR that JrHw can pull into XmmxH

- UnicodeSymbology
  - initially within DiigoH

- factor the Governance considerations promised to Gsd into my notes on these topics

<hr>

### quickActs
- test DiigoH as a Page repo.
  - ...
- use more Headings and their implicit ToC
- start integrating Topics for Contexts that span time periods
  - craft a central SplashScreen/ControlPoint for this GitHub UserId
- learn about: "this branch is" ... "commits ahead" & "commits behind"
- test the many X '*' markup for TwH compatibility
  - this may change the view of Pulse updates
- ㋈ ㋉㋊㋋ ㋀㋁㋂㋃㋄㋅㋆㋇ ; test #HwWvW as a target

* * * GitHub PRs would be a particular boon
## -08-16: floating the BaByTw idea ...
