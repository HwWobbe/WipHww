  * prefered, as more effective editing
    * design assuming that MANY repos can be created to meet the needs of Shared and Distinct membership
      * PR's can then be used to manage the Shared Views and interests
        * confirm my PR creation methods are effective in this context

* assume that a PR could be a single separate file that is attached to a Request

# 2023-01:
* test this more extensively (since I think it should work as a host site)
* * extend this plan
* * * a NodeJs LocalHost focus might be first
* * * * "primitives" users will likely assist by needing additional documentation
* discuss Savers with Eric since he seems to have simplified this
* * consider the need for this capability if BobH or NodeJs use is re-stored
* * it appeared to be as simple as a Saver name change
* * * explore the new TiddlyTools first
* Schedule re-visit(s) to Github as a TwHost site.
* * drive this via Project (as a control point)
* * * consider ToDo capabilities hosted in email, with nonWord Tags
* * * * consider HeadStart contexts
* * * * * test this as a Build (rather than TransClusion)
* * * * this might support the EdD efforts ( assign to Lz )
* * 2022-04-04: enhancing some Project structures at GitHub
* * * Anticipating reduced GitHub use friction as a result of the emerging TwSavers
* * 2021.09.16: consider https://github.com/saqimtiaz/TW5-github-actions-example
* * 2021.08.30 new(er) instructions are emerging and should be tested, from the start.
* * 2021.08.16 review in the light of recent developments
* * keep evolving the twOnly apprach, but remain open minded about the NodeJs version(s) support 
* * * review the NodeJs work CJ has done
* * * * * build a-new using LapH since it is likely to replace SysH ( for SysD use )
* * TiddlyHost meets many of these needs, but does not have adequate Permission granularity for some of my uses. 
* This file could be part of an expanding 'hello-world' introduction that is based on my TiddlyWiki (...Tw) use(s).
* * 2021-03-0?: TiddlyHost becomes the corrent priority
* 2021.02.06: Review API key
* 2021.01.23: start designing Containerization methodologies
* re-test this under Release 5.1.23 now that it is available
* * 2021.01.11: so far, so good
* * * ..16: check for pertinent refinements
* * 2021.01.03: trying for ...pages (again)
* * * 2021.01.04: Upgrading
* an Interim solution may be to use the DropPages interface
* *  http://hww-tw.droppages.com/HwwTw.html
* * * test this option
