# newFolder/newFile

### Lede
* This is now finally confirmed to working, from the StackEdit workspace.
* This folder may be accessible from the link to it in the public "Main workspace".
* The Hints suggest that this file exists in a StackEdit workspace and in my GoogleDrive.

## Background

* This file now exists in one of my repos.
* It seems I can edit this newFolder file, which is likely also stored in my GoogleDrive.
* This folder exists within my GoogleDrive.  It exists within a StackEdit workspace that was created by StackEdit.
* My attempt to place it in the existing Google Workspace likely failed due to Permissions.
