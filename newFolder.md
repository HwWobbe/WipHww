# newFolder

This is finally working, from the StackEdit workspace.  This is now confirmed.

* This file now exists in one of my repos.
* It seems I can edit this newFolder file, which is likely also stored in my GoogleDrive.
* This folder exists within my GoogleDrive.  It exists within a StackEdit workspace that was created by StackEdit.

This folder may be accessible from the link to it in the public "Main workspace".

My attempt to place it in the existing Google Workspace likely failed due to Permissions.

I do not fully understand where these files are originating and how they can be accessed.  The Hints suggest that this file exists in a StackEdit workspace and in my GoogleDrive.
