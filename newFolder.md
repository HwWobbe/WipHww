<p>It seems I can edit this newFolder file, which is likely stored in my GoogleDrive.</p>
<p>This folder exists within my GoogleDrive.  It exists within a StackEdit workspace that was created by StackEdit.</p>
<p>This folder may be accessible from the link to it in the public “Main workspace”.</p>
<p>My attempt to place it in the existing Google Workspace likely failed due to Permissions.</p>
<p>I do not fully understand where these files are originating and how they can be accessed.  The Hints suggest that this file exists in a StackEdit workspace and in my GoogleDrive.</p>
